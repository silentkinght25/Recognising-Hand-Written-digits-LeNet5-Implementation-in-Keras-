# Recognising-Hand-Written-digits-LeNet5-Implementation-in-Keras-
I have used mnist dataset and applied 5 layer Convolutional Neural Network. This implementation is similar to the LeNet5 implementation in Keras, except some of minor changes like instead of sigmoid and tanh activation I have used relu and softmax activations. Moreover the no of filters is also different to give a better accuracy. I have also used data augmentation on the train set. The dataset contains 60000 grayscale images and test set contains 10000 images.
